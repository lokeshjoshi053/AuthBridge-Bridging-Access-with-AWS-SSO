# Introduction

This tool will help you download your AWS organization's account credentials using `AWS SSO`. What we previously set manually with *IAM users* **(aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key)**, we now have automatically using AWS SSO.
In this case ONLY Google Workspaces has been tested as external IDP. 

In short, we want to have the credentials of our `AWS accounts/roles`, using `AWS SSO`, stored in our `~/.aws/credentials` to be able to work daily with our tools **(terraform, aws cli...)**

> This tool requires human interaction, since the authorization request must be manually approved from the browser.

# Requirements

* Our default browser that we work with must be authenticated with our IDP. In this case, gmail if we use Google Workspaces.

# Supported platforms

| OS        | ARM64 | AMD64 |

| Mac       |  √    |   √   |
| Linux     |  √    |   √   |

# Supported IDP

* Google Workspaces

If using other IDP with AWS SSO in your organization, and this tool don't work, please provide feedback in this repo. Open an issue and I will try to reproduce it!

# Installation

cd aws-sso-auth/
cargo build --release
./target/release/aws-sso-auth
```

# Usage

## Setup configuration

```shell
aws-sso-auth config --start-url https://XXXX.awsapps.com/start --aws-region eu-west-1 --profile-name mycompany
```

> This command will save a file in `~/.aws/aws-sso-auth.json` with the previous configuration

* **profile_name:** the name of the profile configuration you are saving. For example, your company name
* **start_url:** your start URL of SSO AWS app (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtochangeURL.html)
* **region:** AWS region where you have your AWS SSO configured. By the default is `us-east-1`


## Start fetching credentials

```shell
aws-sso-auth start
```

Or with flags:

```shell
aws-sso-auth start -w 5 -r 40
```

* **workers:** Number of async/thread AWS API calls. + threads == + speed. Recommended: 5/8 max to avoid AWS API 429 errors TooManyRequestsException. Default: 6
* **retries:** Number of retries when AWS API return errors. Default: 60

> This will open your default local browser where you have your IDP authenticated. In my case, I used Google as external IDP with AWS SSO

> Adjust the number of concurrent threads and retries depending on the number of accounts you have. If you only have 10 accounts (for example), it wouldn't make much sense to maybe use 20 workers and 100 retries, right?

If everything went well, you must authorize the request. Something like that:

## Debug logging

```shell
aws-sso-auth -l debug start
```

* **--log-level:** Log level. Default: info. Possible values: info, warn, trace, debug, error

## Check version

```shell
aws-sso-auth --version
```

## Help command

```shell
aws-sso-auth --help
```

> All the credentials will be saved in your $HOME/.aws/credentials with the following pattern: [AccountName@RoleName] you are assuming

## Take a look inside `~/.aws/credentials`

```shell
cat ~/.aws/credentials
```

The configuration file should be something like this:

## Example of credentials file

```toml
[Account1@administrator]
aws_secret_access_key=XXXX
region=eu-west-1
aws_access_key_id=XXXX
aws_session_token=XXXX

[Account2@read-only]
aws_secret_access_key=XXXX
region=eu-west-1
aws_access_key_id=XXXX
aws_session_token=XXXX
```

# Switching accounts in your terminal

## Zsh/Bash shell

Copy the following function in your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```shell
aws-profile () {
        PROFILE=$(cat ~/.aws/credentials|grep "^\["|sed "s/]$//"|sed "s/^\[//"| fzf)
        export AWS_PROFILE=$PROFILE
}
```

Then, `source` the file if needed:
```shell
source ~/.zshrc or source ~/.bashrc
```

## Fish shell

Copy the following function inside `~/.config/fish/function/aws-profile.fish`

```shell
function aws-profile
    set -gx AWS_PROFILES $(cat ~/.aws/credentials | sed -n -e 's/^\[\(.*\)\]/\1/p' | fzf)
    if test -n "$AWS_PROFILES"
        set -xg AWS_PROFILE $AWS_PROFILES
        echo "Selected profile: $AWS_PROFILES"
    else
        echo "No profile selected"
    end
end
```

Then `source` the fish configuration:

```shell
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

## Setting AWS_PROFILE

Type `aws-profile` in your terminal, and you will see all the accounts you have credentials in your `$HOME/.aws/credentials`

> **fzf** is needed as a dependency for the interactive account switcher

# TO DO (not implemented yet)

* Multiple AWS SSO account configurations inside `aws-sso-auth.json` Imagine you are working in a consultant, and you have multiple customers with AWS SSO, and you want to save
all their config (start-url, region) inside the config file.
* If you have 200 accounts, only 123 (max), will be fetched
* Select which account credentials (with prefix) do you want to fetch (maybe you don't want to fetch all accounts)
* Testing and mocking AWS API calls
* Codecoverage pipeline not working
* Changelog with release-please
* Create Homebrew Formula
* Documentation in code functions
* Customize how account credentials are saved: `[AccountName@RoleName]` for `[PUT-YOUR-LOGIC-HERE]`
